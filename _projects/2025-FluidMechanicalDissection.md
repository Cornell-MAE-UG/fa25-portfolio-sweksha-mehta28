As part of our team’s analysis and dissection of a Sharp surround sound speaker, I took the lead in dissecting speaker components and developing the presentation slides and technical script for our final video ([watch here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bhQ_YkF6kU)). My role centered on translating complex mechanical and fluid-dynamic concepts into clear visual and verbal explanations that captured both the theory and the design rationale behind our system.

To build the foundation for the video, I conducted in-depth research into the key modeling assumptions, examining how each component of the speaker, from the diaphragm to the magnetic coil, contributes to system behavior in fluid applications. I focused on connecting the mechanical motion of the diaphragm with the acoustic pressure fronts and streamline patterns that form in the surrounding medium.

I also illustrated the pressure fronts and streamline diagrams and related them to Navier-Stokes theorem to visually communicate how the design geometry governs sound propagation and efficiency. These visuals helped explain why our specific speaker configuration is optimized for its intended application, tying together our analytical model, experimental observations, and design choices into a coherent narrative.
