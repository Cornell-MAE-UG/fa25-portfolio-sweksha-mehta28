When I joined the Moridi Research Group at Cornell, my first responsibility was to set up and align an optical laser system for materials testing. This required working with beam expanders, mirrors, lenses, and photodetectors, making extremely precise adjustments, since even a tiny misalignment could drastically affect data quality. I spent hours iterating the alignment, testing how small shifts in angle or distance affected the laser’s focus and the resulting droplet ejection. Once the system was stable and droplets were ejected in a controlled and repeatable manner, I created a detailed standard operating procedure with diagrams, documenting each component and step so that future researchers could reproduce the alignment process exactly.

In addition to the optical system, I integrated Teensy and Arduino microcontrollers to control the timing, data acquisition, and actuation of the laser system. This gave me hands-on experience in hardware–software integration, debugging real-time control issues, and collecting high-quality experimental data. I also experimented with automating certain alignment checks, which taught me how small scripts or hardware tweaks can save hours of repetitive work.

This project gave me practical experience in optics, instrumentation, and automation, while exposing me to cutting-edge additive manufacturing technologies such as shadowgraphy and droplet generation. It also strengthened my ability to document and communicate complex experimental setups, a skill I’ve continued to apply in both academic and personal projects. Below is a picture of the laser setup I worked with:
