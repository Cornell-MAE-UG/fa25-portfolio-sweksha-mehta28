For a self-directed side project, I designed a modular mechanum strafing robot base in Fusion 360 as a way to experiment with flexible and manufacturable design principles. I used parametric modeling to create a compact yet sturdy structure capable of accommodating motors, linkages, and PID sensors, ensuring that the design would function reliably while remaining adaptable to different configurations. From the very beginning, I considered assembly and maintenance, carefully planning the placement of fasteners, wiring channels, and sensor mounts to make the robot practical to build and modify.

Throughout the project, I iteratively tested design decisions such as structural thickness, wheel placement, weight distribution, and gear ratios to optimize both stability and mobility. I experimented with different gear ratios to understand how they affected torque, speed, and overall robot performance, allowing me to fine-tune the balance between rapid movement and precise control. This process gave me freedom to explore creative solutions without strict constraints, helping me connect classroom theory in mechanics and robotics with hands-on CAD modeling practice. I also experimented with different strategies for modularity, making it possible to swap components or adjust the base size without redesigning the entire system.

The project strengthened my confidence with Fusion 360, deepened my understanding of robotics design fundamentals, and reinforced the importance of thinking ahead about manufacturability and assembly. Below is a rendering of the robot base highlighting its modular structure and component layout:
