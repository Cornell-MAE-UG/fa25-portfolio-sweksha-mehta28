I joined AguaClara in my freshman fall and began working on a gravity-powered hydraulic ram pump, a system designed to move water upward without electricity using only the energy of flowing water. I spent significant time in the lab running experiments, carefully measuring flow rates, pressure, and overall efficiency, while learning how small design changes, such as altering pipe diameters or valve geometries, could dramatically affect system performance.

To build off of the experiments, I used Fusion 360 to model pump components, iterating on the geometry to optimize water flow, minimize energy loss, and ensure manufacturability. I explored different configurations for the pump chamber, delivery pipe angles, and valve placement, connecting theoretical fluid mechanics concepts with tangible design choices.

In addition to the technical work, I consolidated calculations, CAD files, and testing notes into a comprehensive reference manual. While this was not the original goal of my project, it became a valuable resource for the team, helping future members understand the system, replicate tests, and make informed design improvements. 

One of the main aspects of the pump design I focused on was integrating a second spring support to improve the system’s reliability and efficiency. The hydraulic ram pump relies on precise timing of the check valves and the bounce of the main piston, and the original single-spring setup sometimes led to inconsistent valve actuation under varying flow conditions. I analyzed the dynamics of the piston and spring system, considering factors like spring constant, compression distance, the effect of the hydrostatic water column, and the timing of water pulses, to design a second spring to balance forces and stabilize motion.

Overall, this project gave me hands-on experience in fluid mechanics, iterative prototyping, and technical documentation, while reinforcing the importance of connecting experimental data, simulation, and careful record-keeping. The experience also strengthened my ability to think critically about system performance, anticipate design challenges, and communicate technical findings clearly to both peers and mentors. A picture of the mock-up of the dual support spring system is shown below:
