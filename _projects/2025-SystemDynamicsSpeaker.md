This group project focused on characterizing the dynamic behavior of the Echo Dot speaker system by modeling its  electrical-mechanical response. A third-order displacement-to-voltage transfer function was derived to represent the system, capturing the relationship between input voltage and mechanical displacement. Using this model, the project analyzed the speaker’s open-loop frequency response, generating Bode plots to identify resonance frequencies, gain, and phase behavior. The insights provided a deeper understanding of system stability and bandwidth limitations, which are critical for optimizing audio performance.

In this project, I applied the transfer function to generate Bode plots and perform a frequency response analysis of the Echo Dot, interpreting the results to identify potential areas for design improvement. I also documented the methodology and findings to serve as a foundation for future optimization and control strategy development.
