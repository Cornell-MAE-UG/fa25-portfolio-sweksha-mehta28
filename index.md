Hi! I’m Sweksha Mehta, a junior studying Mechanical Engineering in the Sibley School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Cornell, with a minor in Business. I thrive on ideas that look impossible on paper and become tangible through engineering.

🛠️ Things I’ve worked on:
- Thermal subsystem design for a Mars rover @ NASA L’SPACE
- 3D metal printing research @ Laboratory for Advanced Materials and Manufacturing
- Renewable energy infrastructure @ Syncarpha Capital
- Solar inverter systems @ Chint Power Systems


📈 Current roles:
- Undergraduate Researcher @ Moridi Research Group at Cornell 
- Fabrication Engineer @ AguaClara Cornell
- Volunteer Curriculum Developer @ JerseySTEM (robotics & engineering education)
- Thermodynamics Undergraduate TA @ Cornell University 
- Member @ Alpha Omega Epsilon Beta Chi Chapter 

This portfolio brings together some of the projects I’ve been most excited to work on, and I’d love for you to see where that curiosity has taken me so far.
